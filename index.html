            <p> Hi. My name is Amreeta Choudhury. I have a Masters degree of Statistics and Biostatistics from Rutgers University. Over the past few
                    years, I have had an interesting history
                    as an Adjunct Professor of NJIT, a Data Science Consultant              and this past year, I worked in Wall Street as a Statistical analyst. My client was Full Beauty Brands, a corporation owning online and retail stores Lane Bryant, King Size, Brylane Home, Swimsuits for all.  Throughout my career, the one thing that has always stood out to me was the website and programming component of my work. 
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    For fun, I love traveling! My goal
                    is to become the best developer I can be
                    but also to visit each continent at 
                    least once! My favorite
                    vacations have been in Alaska and Greece. 
                     Meanwhile, check out my profile on <a href = "http://www.github.com/amreetac/">Github </a> or feel free to reach me anytime on my <a href = "https://fast-tundra-81170.herokuapp.com/contact.html">Contact page! </a>
